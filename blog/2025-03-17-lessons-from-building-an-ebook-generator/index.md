title: What's the best prompt approach?
---

Last Friday, I tried to create a simple ebook generator using Cursor and Claude Sonnet 3.7. The idea is simple: provide a topic as input, and it generates an ebook.

<!-- truncate -->

My initial approach was to create the entire script in one shot. However, nothing worked. I experimented with different prompts, packages, and languages, but I always encountered issues with generating or saving files.

So, I gave up and went to sleep. The next day, I tried again, breaking down the script into individual steps: generating an ebook summary, creating chapters with AI, converting MD to PDF, merging PDF files, etc. I completed it in 1 hour, including tests and fine-tuning.

I always get better results with the second approach.
