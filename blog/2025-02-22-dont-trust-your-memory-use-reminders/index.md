title: Don't trust your memory. Use reminders!
---

Stop overloading your mind with dates, delegate them to a calendar. Remove even small tasks from your head.

<!-- truncate -->

Need to pay a bill? Schedule it.
Want to check an email later? Snooze it.
Grandma's dinner? Add it to your calendar.

ðŸ‘‰ What I use for reminders:
- Slack reminders: To check a thread or answer someone.
- Gmail "Snooze" option: To check or reply to an email later.
- Google Calendar: For everything else (events, appointments, and recurring tasks like payment days)
