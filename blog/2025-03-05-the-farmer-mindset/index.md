I've been practicing this lately. Why?

We often focus on short-term results, but neglect the actions that lead to long-term results.

Planting is an action with a long-term goal that may or may not succeed. However, the seed is planted, and the chance of success is at least greater than zero.

With that in mind, let me ask you: How many seeds are you planting? What kind of crop are you preparing for the future? Or is your soil empty?

Let's be more practical. What are you doing today that could lead to a great result in the future? I'll answer for myself.
 
One type of seed I'm planting is to expose myself more. I'm doing this now through these posts. Maybe it won't give any results, but the seed is here, planted.
